# Brushed Motor Notes
## PCB Unit Testing
- Setup: Just the PCB + Programmer + Laptop
- PCB Unit Test
    - Continunity
    - Resistance maybe

- MCU Programmable?
    - See if MCU is programmable and has stable current draw
- Relay Verfiication
    - Test all 4 possible states with 48V input

- PWM Verification: Run PWM test case to check stability
    - Run PWM Test Case
